application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

This is a rebuild of the Hyperloop variant of Aquarius.  There were too many trials and errors getting the first version set up, so it is best to regenerate and focus on bringing the new one up cleanly.
